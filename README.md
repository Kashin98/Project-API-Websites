# Project-API-Websites
Built Multiple websites using APIs to understand AJAX programming. Also used bootstrap 4 framework for CSS to practice.

Hosted on AWS S3 bucket, but there is an issue hosting the website on Netlify and AWS Cloudfront. The services request the website's resources over a https secure conn. While most of the APIs I used are delivering the resources over https. The Open Weather API requires I pay 40$ a month to request API calls over https. This problem alone has made me host this website from my s3 bucket's unsecure endpoint and thus not be able to use the other services.

This issue was not foreseen when I was building the website. It's a small setback, but a secure connection is not a very important necessity for a website which doesn't take any personal/sensitive informtion from users.


This is the bucket's direct Endpoint "http://project-cyberware.s3-website.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com"

Learned how to:

1.) AJAX programming and all it's concepts.

2.) Understood and practiced Bootstrap 4 framework for CSS.

3.) Understanding APIs and JSON data.

(All used AWS services expire around end of 2021 for this project)
